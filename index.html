            <h2>A Visualization of Misconception:</h2>
            <div class="message">
                <p>This visualization shows the misconception of safety in Toronto neighbourhoods as a correlation to community housing.</p> <p>The 20 top community housing neighborhoods, ranked by population ratio, are not leaders in neighbourhood crimes. That is, there is no obvious relationship between the type or rate of crime in a neighbourhood and that of the neighbourhood's community housing population ratio.</p>

                    <p>In recent years news of fires, violence and crime surrounding community housing has been in the spot light and has put these low-income housing communities on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY" target="_blank">NIMBY</a> list, along with wind turbines and solar panels.</p>
